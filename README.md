# Redshift Immersion Day Labs
This GitHub project provides a series of lab exercises which help users get started using the Redshift platform.

## Goals
Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse solution that uses columnar storage to minimise IO, provides high data compression rates, and offers fast performance. This GitHub project provides a series of lab exercises which help users get started using the Redshift platform.  It also helps demonstrate the many features built into the platform.
